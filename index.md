                # Validate (and improve) an idea that’s already being built

                “If you’ve got an early prototype, this is a fast way to understand how it’s useful to people. Make sure you approach them with a smile!” - &laquo;author&raquo;

                                  ## You’ll need

                                  * A few days
                                  * A few minds
                                  * A clickable prototype (you can always build one yourself)
                                  

                </div>

                  ## Plan
                  Draw up a script and scenario to test with users

                  Write and memorise a short script that explains who you are, what you’re testing and what you need from the person completing the test (including how long). You can use this template to get started.  

                  ## Learn

                  Hit the streets and put your idea in the hands of users

                  Head to a public location that you think your users are likely to be in and politely approach people with your product and script.  

                  Ask them to use your prototype and explain their decisions as they go.  

                  Take note of the key learnings after each session, and once you have 3-5 quality responses, you can head back to the office to draw out your conclusions.  



                  ## Act

                  Turn your key learnings into proposed improvements

                  Using your conclusions, come up with improvements with your product.  



                  Prepare a simple slide deck for your leader featuring
                  * your approach to testing,  
                  * your key learnings  
                  * your proposed improvements.
